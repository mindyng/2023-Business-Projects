    "# Why/Motivation: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. I was really intrigued by the recent development of Anthropic's chatbot, Claude, a supposedly more ethical chatbot compared to openAI's, chatGPT. I really wanted to test its capabilities of being more \"ethical\" to see if it was measuring up to its value proposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I wanted to do sentiment analysis of responses across the world wide web to see which one is most trusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Good for me to get updated on NLP techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fun to see how the world thinks of chatGPT/Claude and what they think of themselves. (turning Q & A on themselves. self-introspection)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Wanted to see if can do sentiment analysis across multiple emotions to not have such a Black and White assessment of statements since feelings/people's positions are usually not polar, but spead across a variety of feelings.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Not just explore Twitter (X) and Reddit, but also pop songs for real-time relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Look at fresh time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Explore a different viz py lib: d3.js to build more sophisticated, interactive viz for web portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "# Business Recommendation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought this would be a nice twist on sentiment analysis on product launches. This is something I was looking to do since coming from product analytics, experimentation looked at event signals versus what people were actually saying about the product. People say that actions are louder than words, but words also speak volumes. Would have been nice to have complemented by experimentation resuslts with some sort of sentiment analysis. Would have added more weight, been more comprehensive assessment of new feature launches."
